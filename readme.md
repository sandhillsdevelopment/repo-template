# Sandhills Development - Repo Template
## What is this repo?
This repository serves as a way for the development teams at Sandhills Development to manage, unify, and maintain our labels and templates within our GitHub repositories.

## Why unify things?
As our development staff grows, the likelyhood that we work on muliple projects grows, so making a standard set of templates, labels, procedures, and processes is necessary in order to limit friction when working between the teams.

## Our goal...
We aim to have a standard set of labels between all projects and repositories, including the way they are cased, prefixed, and color coded in order to allow changes to be applied via semi-automated methods, and openly discuss changes to our labels and templates for issues and improvement requests.

## How to use this repository.
When the need for a new 'global' or 'semi-global' label is needed, we can discuss the naming, color, and prefixing prior to implementing it to all our organizations. Issues should be opened against this repository for discussion, explaining the need, goal, and clarification into why the change would be helpful. This way the entire development staff can have some input into how our labels are maintained.

Our issue and improvement templates should serve as a way to help produce quality requests to the development staff, that reduces the need for non-asyncronous conversations and explain in detail the needs from the development staff. This prevents a bug or improvement from needing 'followup' at a later date.
